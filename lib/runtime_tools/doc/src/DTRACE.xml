<title>History</title>

<p>
The first implementation of DTrace probes for the Erlang virtual
machine was presented at the <url href="http://www.erlang.org/euc/08/">2008 Erlang User Conference</url>.  That
work, based on the Erlang/OTP R12 release, was discontinued due to
what appears to be miscommunication with the original developers.
</p>

<p>
Several users have created Erlang port drivers, linked-in drivers, or
NIFs that allow Erlang code to try to activate a probe,
e.g. <c>foo_module:dtrace_probe("message goes here!")</c>.
</p>

<marker id="Goals"/>
<title>Goals</title>

<list type="bulleted"><item>
Annotate as much of the Erlang VM as is practical.

</item>
<item>
The initial goal is to trace file I/O operations.

</item>
<item>
Support all platforms that implement DTrace: OS X, Solaris,
and (I hope) FreeBSD and NetBSD.

</item>
<item>
To the extent that it's practical, support SystemTap on Linux
via DTrace provider compatibility.

</item>
<item>
Allow Erlang code to supply annotations.

</item></list>
</section>

<section>
<marker id="Supported-platforms"/>
<title>Supported platforms</title>

<list type="bulleted"><item>
OS X 10.6.x / Snow Leopard, OS X 10.7.x / Lion and probably newer versions.

</item>
<item>
Solaris 10.  I have done limited testing on Solaris 11 and
OpenIndiana release 151a, and both appear to work.

</item>
<item>
FreeBSD 9.0 and 10.0.

</item>
<item>
Linux via SystemTap compatibility.  Please see
<seealso marker="SYSTEMTAP">$ERL_TOP/HOWTO/SYSTEMTAP.md</seealso> for more details.

</item></list>
<p>
Just add the <c>--with-dynamic-trace=dtrace</c> option to your command when you 
run the <c>configure</c> script. If you are using systemtap, the configure option 
is <c>--with-dynamic-trace=systemtap</c>
</p>

<title>Status</title>

<p>
As of R15B01, the dynamic trace code is included in the OTP source distribution,
although it's considered experimental. The main development of the dtrace code 
still happens outside of Ericsson, but there is no need to fetch a patched 
version of the OTP source to get the basic funtionality.

<title>Implementation summary</title>

<p>
So far, most effort has been focused on the <c>efile_drv.c</c> code,
which implements most file I/O on behalf of the Erlang virtual
machine.  This driver also presents a big challenge: its use of an I/O
worker pool (enabled by using the <c>erl +A 8</c> flag, for example) makes
it much more difficult to trace I/O activity because each of the
following may be executed in a different Pthread:
</p>

<list type="bulleted"><item>
I/O initiation (Erlang code)

</item>
<item>
I/O proxy process handling, e.g. read/write when file is not opened
in <c>raw</c> mode, operations executed by the code &amp; file server processes.
(Erlang code)

</item>
<item>
<c>efile_drv</c> command setup (C code)

</item>
<item>
<c>efile_drv</c> command execution (C code)

</item>
<item>
<c>efile_drv</c> status return (C code)

</item></list>
<p>
Example output from <c>lib/runtime_tools/examples/efile_drv.d</c> while executing
<c>file:rename("old-name", "new-name")</c>:
</p>

<code type="none">
efile_drv enter tag={3,84} user tag some-user-tag | RENAME (12) | args: old-name new-name ,\
      0 0 (port #Port&lt;0.59&gt;)
async I/O worker tag={3,83} | RENAME (12) | efile_drv-int_entry
async I/O worker tag={3,83} | RENAME (12) | efile_drv-int_return
efile_drv return tag={3,83} user tag  | RENAME (12) | errno 2
</code>
<p>
... where the following key can help decipher the output:
</p>

<list type="bulleted"><item>
<c>{3,83}</c> is the Erlang scheduler thread number (3) and operation
counter number (83) assigned to this I/O operation.  Together,
these two numbers form a unique ID for the I/O operation.

</item>
<item>
<c>12</c> is the command number for the rename operation.  See the
definition for <c>FILE_RENAME</c> in the source code file <c>efile_drv.c</c>
or the <c>BEGIN</c> section of the D script <c>lib/runtime_tools/examples/efile_drv.d</c>.

</item>
<item>
<c>old-name</c> and <c>new-name</c> are the two string arguments for the
source and destination of the <c>rename(2)</c> system call.
The two integer arguments are unused; the simple formatting code
prints the arguments anyway, 0 and 0.

</item>
<item>
The worker pool code was called on behalf of Erlang port <c>#Port&lt;0.59&gt;</c>.

</item>
<item>
The system call failed with a POSIX errno value of 2: <c>ENOENT</c>,
because the path <c>old-name</c> does not exist.

</item>
<item>
The <c>efile_drv-int_entry</c> and <c>efile_drv_int_return</c> probes are
provided in case the user is
interested in measuring only the latency of code executed by
<c>efile_drv</c> asynchronous functions by I/O worker pool threads
and the OS system call that they encapsulate.

</item></list>
<p>
So, where does the <c>some-user-tag</c> string come from?
</p>

<p>
At the moment, the user tag comes from code like the following:
</p>

<code type="none">
dyntrace:put_tag("some-user-tag"),
file:rename("old-name", "new-name"),
</code>
<p>
This method of tagging I/O at the Erlang level is subject to change.
